yamwlib
=======

shared code between yamw and other projects

Things I want to do here
========================

 - SymbolLoader
   - May be used for autoloading
   - Know about class hierarchy and implementations, even in reverse order
   - May work as autoloader, too (coming soon)
 - New Application Style
   - Do not depend on configuration of database to write applications - just follow the convention for application / controller routing to work and your menu buttons etc. to appear
   - No manual registering of new applications - everything is done per class hierarchy. We know when you added a new application .(¬.¬),.
 - Support for some stuff of the Alamo engine
   - Currently .dat text file reading only - writing coming soon
